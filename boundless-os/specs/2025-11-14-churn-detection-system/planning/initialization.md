# Spec Initialization: Churn Detection System

## Raw Idea
AI-powered churn detection system that analyzes EA daily reports using two types of rules: Logic Rules (fast, free pattern matching on structured fields) and AI Text Rules (Claude API analyzes text fields for patterns and sentiment). The system automatically detects churn risk patterns and triggers prioritized alerts when risk is detected.
