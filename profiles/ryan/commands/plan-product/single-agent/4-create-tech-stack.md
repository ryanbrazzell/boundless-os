The final part of our product planning process is to document this product's tech stack in `boundless-os/product/tech-stack.md`.  Follow these instructions to do so:

{{workflows/planning/create-product-tech-stack}}

## Important

The standards' "Recommended Stack (2025)" is guidance, not a mandate. Before adopting it:
- Run the Fit Checklist (SSR/SEO, region/compliance, team familiarity, provider commitments, realtime needs, budget).
- Present 1–2 alternatives with pros/cons if any item fails the fit check.
- Ask the founder to confirm the final selection before creating the document.

## Display confirmation and next step

Once you've created tech-stack.md, output the following message:

```
✅ I have documented the product's tech stack at `boundless-os/product/tech-stack.md`.

Review it to ensure all of the tech stack details are correct for this product.

You're ready to start planning a feature spec! You can do so by running `shape-spec.md` or `write-spec.md`.
