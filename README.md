# Boundless OS

**Transform AI coding agents from confused interns into productive developers**

Boundless OS is a structured development framework that guides AI coding assistants (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf) through proven workflows to build production-ready code that matches your standards—every time.

## 🎯 The Problem

Without Boundless OS, AI agents:
- Generate inconsistent code that doesn't match your style
- Make architectural decisions without understanding your vision
- Produce implementations that work "technically" but aren't production-ready
- Require constant back-and-forth prompting

## ✨ The Solution

Boundless OS provides:
- **Standards** - Your coding style, design principles, and best practices
- **Structured Workflows** - 6-phase process from idea to working code
- **Product Context** - Your mission, roadmap, and vision guide every decision
- **Specialized Agents** - Different AI agents for different tasks (planning, specs, implementing)

**Result**: Production-ready code that matches your standards on the first try.

## 🚀 Quick Start (2 Minutes)

### 1. Install Boundless OS Base

```bash
git clone https://github.com/buildermethods/boundless-os ~/boundless-os
```

### 2. Run Interactive Wizard

```bash
cd ~/my-project  # or create a new project folder
~/boundless-os/scripts/wizard-install.sh
```

The wizard will:
- Ask about your technical level and project type
- Configure the right profile for you
- Install Boundless OS into your project
- Tell you exactly what to do next

### 3. Start Building

```bash
claude-code  # or open your AI coding tool
```

Run your first command:
```
/plan-product
```

**That's it!** Boundless OS will guide you through planning your product and building features.

## 💡 Key Features

### ✅ **Spec-Driven Development**
Stop going back and forth with AI. Define what you want once, get it right the first time.

### ✅ **Multiple AI Tools Supported**
Works with:
- **Claude Code** (recommended) - Best integration, multi-agent support
- **Cursor** - AI-first code editor
- **Windsurf** - Codeium's AI IDE
- **Any AI tool** that can read markdown files

### ✅ **Non-Technical Founder Friendly**
The "ryan" profile is specifically designed for founders without coding experience:
- Plain language communication (no jargon)
- S-tier design standards (Stripe/Notion quality)
- Visual testing (see it work, not just code)
- Security by default

### ✅ **Production-Ready Code**
Not prototypes—actual production code with:
- Tests included automatically
- Security best practices
- Accessible UI (screen readers, keyboard navigation)
- Professional design
- Error handling
- Comments in plain language

### ✅ **Any Language, Any Framework**
Boundless OS is language-agnostic. Supports:
- JavaScript/TypeScript (React, Next.js, Vue, etc.)
- Python (Django, FastAPI, etc.)
- Ruby (Rails), PHP (Laravel), Java (Spring Boot)
- And more—you choose the tech stack

---

## 🏗️ The 6-Phase Workflow

```
1. Plan Product    → Define mission, roadmap, tech stack (once per project)
2. Shape Spec      → Plan a feature through Q&A
3. Write Spec      → Convert to formal specification
4. Create Tasks    → Break into implementable tasks
5. Implement       → Build the feature (with tests!)
6. Verify          → Automatic quality & security checks

Result: Working feature in 1-3 hours (vs days of back-and-forth)
```

**See [WORKFLOW.md](WORKFLOW.md) for detailed explanation with examples.**

## 👥 Who Is This For?

### Perfect For:
- **Non-technical founders** with a product idea but no coding experience
- **Solo developers** building SaaS products, marketplaces, or tools
- **Small teams** wanting consistent code quality
- **Anyone** tired of prompting AI agents repeatedly

### You Should Use Boundless OS If:
- You want AI to build production-quality code, not prototypes
- You have (or need) clear standards for your codebase
- You're building something with multiple features
- You want structured workflows, not freeform prompting

## 🎓 Example: Building User Authentication

Traditional way (without Boundless OS):
```
You: "Build user authentication"
AI:  [generates code]
You: "No, I wanted it to look like Stripe's UI"
AI:  [rewrites everything]
You: "And it needs to use Clerk, not custom auth"
AI:  [starts over again]
... 4-5 iterations later ...
```

**With Boundless OS:**
```
You: /shape-spec user-authentication
AI:  [asks clarifying questions upfront]
     [checks your design standards]
     [creates formal specification]

You: /implement-tasks user-authentication
AI:  [builds exactly what was spec'd]
     [follows your design principles automatically]
     [uses Clerk per your tech stack]
     [tests everything]
     [Done in one pass!]
```
