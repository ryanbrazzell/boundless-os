# Product Mission

## Pitch
Boundless OS Churn Detection is an AI-powered platform that helps Client Success Managers prevent churn by automatically analyzing daily Executive Assistant reports and surfacing only the relationships that need intervention—enabling CSMs to manage 3x more clients while catching issues 2-4 weeks earlier than manual review.

## Users

### Primary Customers
- **Client Success Managers**: CSMs who manage multiple EA-Client relationships and need to identify at-risk pairings before churn happens
- **Heads of Client Success**: Leaders who oversee client relationships and need visibility into team health and risk indicators
- **Heads of EAs**: Managers who support Executive Assistants and need insights into EA performance, attendance, and coaching needs

### User Personas

**Client Success Manager** (25-40 years old)
- **Role:** Manages portfolio of 20-50 EA-Client pairings
- **Context:** Currently spends hours manually reading daily EA reports to spot problems
- **Pain Points:** Can't scale to more clients, misses early warning signs, reactive instead of proactive
- **Goals:** Identify issues early, prioritize interventions, manage more relationships efficiently

**Head of Client Success** (30-45 years old)
- **Role:** Strategic oversight of all client relationships and team performance
- **Context:** Needs high-level visibility without getting lost in details
- **Pain Points:** Hard to see which clients need attention, no systematic way to track relationship health
- **Goals:** Quick visibility into client health, data-driven decisions, prevent churn at scale

**Head of EAs** (28-45 years old)
- **Role:** Manages team of Executive Assistants, provides coaching and support
- **Context:** Needs to track EA performance, attendance, and provide timely coaching
- **Pain Points:** Hard to track attendance patterns, don't know which EAs need support, coaching notes scattered
- **Goals:** Proactive EA support, consistent attendance tracking, centralized coaching system

**Executive Assistant** (22-35 years old)
- **Role:** Provides daily support to clients, submits end-of-day reports

- **Goals:** Fast report submission, see coaching notes, understand expectations

## The Problem

### Manual Churn Detection is Too Slow and Doesn't Scale
Client Success Managers currently read every daily EA report manually to spot relationship problems. This approach:
- **Doesn't scale**: CSMs can only manage 10-15 relationships effectively
- **Misses early signals**: By the time problems are obvious in reports, it's often too late
- **Reactive instead of proactive**: Issues are caught 2-4 weeks later than they could be
- **Wastes time**: CSMs spend hours reading reports for relationships that are healthy

**Our Solution:** AI automatically analyzes every report against customizable churn detection rules, calculates relationship health scores, and triggers prioritized alerts only when intervention is needed. CSMs see dashboards with only the pairings that need attention, allowing them to manage 3x more clients while catching issues 2-4 weeks earlier.

## Differentiators

### AI-Powered Pattern Detection
Unlike manual review or simple keyword alerts, our system analyzes patterns across multiple reports over time. We detect subtle signals like "EA mentions 'micromanaging' in 3 separate reports within 21 days" that humans might miss.

### Actionable Alerts Only
We don't flood CSMs with every report. Our system only surfaces relationships that need intervention, prioritized by severity. CSMs can focus on what matters instead of reading everything.

### Customizable Rules Without Code
CSMs can create, edit, and disable alert rules directly in the app—no developers needed. Rules can trigger on single reports (immediate) or patterns over time (trending).

### Real-Time Coaching System
Coaching notes are visible to EAs in real-time, both at the EA level (general feedback) and pairing level (client-specific guidance). This ensures EAs always know what to focus on.
